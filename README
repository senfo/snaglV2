SnagL™ (Social Network Analysis Graph Live) is a light-weight, pluggable Silverlight application that operates within the browser. It works with existing applications and databases to provide a visual way to understand information and enhance the understanding of it. In more general terms, it is an application that can be easily added to an existing web site and is used to view and analyze data in a visual manner.

SnagL™ was an active R&D project being developed and it was decided to release it to you, the development community, as open source.  Since this product was actively being supported, this CodePlex project will not be maintained and updated often (at least monthly).
